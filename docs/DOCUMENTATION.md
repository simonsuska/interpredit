## üö¶ Start and End

### `SET`

---

**Description** \
The SET command initializes the memory (the tape) with the given number of fields and must be the
first command in every program. All fields are initialized with the number 0.

- **Value**: The number of memory fields to be initialized
- **Value range**: `[0;100]`

**Example** \
`SET 5` initializes the memory as follows.

**Description** \
The HLT command marks the end of a program and must be the last command in every program. 

- **Value**: Unused, only for conformity purposes
- **Value range**: `[INT_MIN;INT_MAX]`

**Example** \

## ‚ûï Arithmetic Operations

### `ADD`

---

**Description** \
The ADD command adds the value stored in the given memory address to the value currently 
stored in the accumulator.

- **Value**: The memory address containing the value that is added to the value in the accumulator
- **Value range**: `[1;SET_VALUE]`

**Example** \
`ADD 2` takes the value in memory address 2 (which is 17) and adds it to the accumulator. 
The result of this addition is 21 and remains in the accumulator.

## üì≠ Input and Output

### `INP`

---

**Description** \
The INP command stores the user input in the given memory address. The program execution
is paused until a user input is made. User input made before the program is actually executed is also taken into 
account.

- **Value**: The memory address the user input is stored in
- **Value range**: `[1;SET_VALUE]`

**Example** \
`INP 2` takes the user input and writes it in the memory address 2.

The OUT command outputs the value stored in the given memory address on the console.

- **Value**: The memory address containing the value that is output on the console
- **Value range**: `[1;SET_VALUE]`

**Example** \
`OUT 2` takes the value stored in the memory address 2 and outputs it on the console.

## üêá Jumps

### `JMP`

---

**Description** \
The JMP command causes the program execution to continue in the given line of code. The program
is trapped in an infinite loop if the target line of code is beyond the SET or HLT command.

- **Value**: The line of code the program execution should continue in
- **Value range**: `[1;LINES_OF_CODE]`

**Example**
```
4: ...
5: SUB 1
6: STA 2
7: JMP 9
8: OUT 2
9: HLT 0
```
`JMP 9` causes the program execution to continue in line 9. This results in the OUT command in 
line 8 not being executed.

### `JEZ`

---

**Description** \
The JEZ command causes the program execution to continue in the given line of code, if the currently 
stored value in the accumulator is equal to 0. Otherwise, the program execution continues in the 
next line of code. The program is trapped in an infinite loop if the target line of code is beyond 
the SET or HLT command.

- **Value**: The line of code the program execution should continue in
- **Value range**: `[1;LINES_OF_CODE]`

**Example**
```
4:  ...
5: SUB 1
6: STA 2
7: OUT 2
8: JEZ 5
9: HLT 0
```
`JEZ 5` causes the program execution to continue in line 5 (which is the `SUB 1` command), if the 
currently stored value in the accumulator is equal to 0. Otherwise, the program execution continues 
in line 9 (which is the `HLT 0` command).

### `JNE`

---

**Description** \
The JNE command causes the program execution to continue in the given line of code, if the currently
stored value in the accumulator is not equal to 0. Otherwise, the program execution continues in the
next line of code. The program is trapped in an infinite loop if the target line of code is beyond
the SET or HLT command.

- **Value**: The line of code the program execution should continue in
- **Value range**: `[1;LINES_OF_CODE]`

**Example**
```
4:  ...
5: SUB 1
6: STA 2
7: OUT 2
8: JNE 5
9: HLT 0
```
`JNE 5` causes the program execution to continue in line 5 (which is the `SUB 1` command), if the
currently stored value in the accumulator is not equal to 0. Otherwise, the program execution 
continues in line 9 (which is the `HLT 0` command).

### `JLZ`

---

**Description** \
The JLZ command causes the program execution to continue in the given line of code, if the currently
stored value in the accumulator is less than 0. Otherwise, the program execution continues in the
next line of code. The program is trapped in an infinite loop if the target line of code is beyond
the SET or HLT command.

- **Value**: The line of code the program execution should continue in
- **Value range**: `[1;LINES_OF_CODE]`

**Example**
```
4:  ...
5: SUB 1
6: STA 2
7: OUT 2
8: JLZ 5
9: HLT 0
```
`JLZ 5` causes the program execution to continue in line 5 (which is the `SUB 1` command), if the
currently stored value in the accumulator is less than 0. Otherwise, the program execution
continues in line 9 (which is the `HLT 0` command).

### `JLE`

---

**Description** \
The JLE command causes the program execution to continue in the given line of code, if the currently
stored value in the accumulator is less than or equal to 0. Otherwise, the program execution continues 
in the next line of code. The program is trapped in an infinite loop if the target line of code is 
beyond the SET or HLT command.

- **Value**: The line of code the program execution should continue in

8: JLE 5
9: HLT 0
```
`JLE 5` causes the program execution to continue in line 5 (which is the `SUB 1` command), if the
currently stored value in the accumulator is less than or equal to 0. Otherwise, the program 
execution continues in line 9 (which is the `HLT 0` command).

### `JGZ`

---

**Description** \
The JGZ command causes the program execution to continue in the given line of code, if the currently
